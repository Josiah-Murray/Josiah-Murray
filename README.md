## Me - Josiah
I'm an applied mathematics PhD student studying railway infrastructure dynamics. Much of my research involves some level of scientific computing, but I also occasionally tinker with personal projects in my free time.


### My README.md is a work in progress, check in ~~soon~~ at some point in the future!
