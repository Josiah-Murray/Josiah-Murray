# Hey! Welcome.
<p align='center'> Just note, this is a work  in progress. </p>

## Me - Josiah
I'm an applied mathematics honours student studying partial differential equations and mathematical modelling. On occasion, I have some coding to do for uni, but I also tinker with personal projects in my free time. I've been looking to take my coding up a notch and thought GitHub would be a good place to start!

This should be a picture of a random fox pulled from an API, updated daily:

</p>

## To do:
 - [x] Figure out how to make GitHub profile
 - [x] Figure out how to edit GitHub profile using code
 - [x] Spend far too long not doing assignments and instead trying to make an API call in node.js
 - [x] Figure out how to use GitHub actions
 - [x] Automate my profile updating script
 - [ ] Actually do something interesting with my newfound skills
 - [ ] Finish making this profile page
